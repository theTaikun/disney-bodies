# Disney Bodies

Visualizing different female body types using various animated characters, not necessarily Disney.

There is some confusion about the terms used to describe different body types, and what is seen as conventionally attractive. This project aims to provide some much needed clarity using familiar characters.

The main takeawy is that either extreme end of the spectrum is undesirable, and the best place to be is somewhere in the middle.

This project only takes into account body type, and doesn't consider face, personality, or social satus. **This project is by no means a scale of overall attractiveness.**

## Contributing Characters
Feel free to add to the list. See the _characters/ directory for examples, and make your own .md file. Then add a picture to the assets/images/ folder. That's it. Afterwards feel free to submit a pull request. Some rules for character contribution:
1. Images are required and must be from the original animated source. No fan works or derivations.
2. Must be western animation (preferably Disney but exceptions will be made).
3. Be realistic with the body number you assign. It should make sense in context with the others in the ecollection.

## Credits
Built with Jekyll, but layouts were hand made.
Everyone has a different concept of attractiveness. This is just my opinion.
